# Your Express.js Application with PM2, Docker, and Docker Compose

This repository contains a simple Express.js application configured to run with PM2 in a Docker container. Docker Compose is used to simplify the deployment and orchestration of the application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-express-pm2-docker-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-express-pm2-docker-app
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will build the Docker image and start the container in detached mode.

4. Access your Express.js application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove the Docker containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Customization

- **Express.js Configuration**: Customize your Express.js application by modifying the relevant files in the project.
